<h1>The Best TV Series According to Payal</h1>
<h2>My top 4 TV series of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. F.R.I.E.N.D.S</h3>
<p>
  This is my first ever sitcom. The unique characters, the story that unfolds
  between them & the amazing humour make me love it a lot. Ive re-watched the
  entire series atleast 10 times till now & it will be my go-to show to watch
  during mhy meals. Also. its the first show where me and my husband now bonded
  over when we were friends.
</p>

<h3>2. Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>
  This is the second favourite show for both of us. My husband watch it with me
  the second time. Sometimes, it felt that the story went slow, but the amazing
  story line, mind blowing characters and the end, no show can beat it in
  thrillers.<br />
  The character Walter White's reason to get involved into the drug
  manufacturing business that he mentions in the end is that he did it all for
  fun. He liked the feeling, even though it was illegal and constantly mentioned
  all through the show that he did it for his family. This actual reason
  somewhere is relatable for any illegal or wrong thing we do in life. We do it
  because we like it, we might not want to admit it, but it is the subconscious
  reason. And that was my favourite part of the show.

<h3>3. Big Bang Theory</h3>
<p>
  BBT. The most nerdy show that ever exists. Loved everything, the characters,
  the science and my second favourite character, Sheldon. Just Muahh! A must
  watch for all scienece enthus.
</p>

<h3>4. Suits</h3>
<p>
  When you are in love with formals,please watch this show! LOL! that's the
  reason I actually started watching it for the first time. The amazing attire
  of US lawyers, their attitude, their love for their work, amazing dialogues
  and beautiful songs, have added a lot of them to my favourites. Another must
  watch if you love seeing people solving problems!
